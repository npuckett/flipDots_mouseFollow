basic setup for flipDot display using Processing
This file shows a simple method of drawing to a flipdot display using Processing.
The behavior described can be seen <a href="https://vimeo.com/136869177">HERE</a>
This example is for a single panel, but they can be tiled together and the script can be extended to accomodate this. To link the panels from processing use a USB to RS-485 <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9822">converter</a>.
